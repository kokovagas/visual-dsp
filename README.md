A Visual Introduction to DSP for SDR
====================================

This is an animated slide deck providing a tour of digital signal processing topics relevant to implementation of software-defined radios, focusing on building visual/geometric intuition for signals.

Topics covered:

* Complex (IQ) and analytic signals.
* Filtering (FIR and IIR).
* Frequency shifting.
* Sampling rates and the Nyquist limit.
* The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT).
* Digital modulation (OOK, PSK, QPSK, QAM).

History
-------

I originally wrote down the idea for this presentation as follows:

> sdr tutorial idea:  
> starting from interactive slide deck w/ live spiral-graph display  
> transform it in multiple ways  
> a fft corresponds to successive amounts of untwist + sum (does it?)  
> Use the MathBox WebGL framework

That sat around for a while until <a href="https://twitter.com/spenchdotnet">Balint Seeber</a> organized <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cyberspectrum/">a meetup group for SDR</a> local to me, in November 2014, and I saw an excuse to do this thing — and here it is, exactly as originally conceived.

[Here's the recording of that meetup with me giving this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUGr_Z04SKs&t=12m30s). Note that this version does not include the material on digital modulations.
